# Data Description
The fasta files contain the R-L-R sequences in the RIP-ed progenies and their coresponding parent strains. For each strain, PCR  and Sanger sequencing were used to get the sequences of R-L-R location, and the resulting segments were aligned to their reference sequences in parent strains, as presented in the  RLR_refseq_annotation.fas file on github (https://github.com/jujushen/NcrassaRID).

In each file, the reference sequences are listed ahead while the sequences of progenies follow. 
The files with suffix '0.3' are the R-L-R system with original sequences, while files with 5eu and 10eu suffixes are files containing results with 95% and 90% itdentities.
