# Data Description
The fasta files contain the R-L-R sequences in the RIP-ed progenies and their coresponding parent strains. For each strain, PCR  and Sanger sequencing were used to get the sequences of R-L-R location, and the resulting segments were aligned to their reference sequences in parent strains, as presented in the  RLR_refseq_annotation.fas file on github (https://github.com/jujushen/NcrassaRID) .
